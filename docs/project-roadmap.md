## Executive Summary

ContribAI is a mature autonomous AI contribution system. Originally built in Python (v0.x–v4.0), it was rewritten in Rust (v5.0.0) for performance, safety, and new capabilities like tree-sitter AST parsing and PageRank file ranking. v5.2.0 added an interactive TUI and full CLI parity. v5.3.0 introduced watchlist mode and 13-language AST. v5.4.0 added dream memory consolidation and risk classification. v5.5.0 delivers multi-file PRs, end-to-end issue solving, and conversation memory. v5.6.0 adds integration tests, LLM retry with backoff, GitHub rate limiter, and the doctor command. v5.7.0–v5.8.0 deliver cross-file import resolution, hunt CLI fix, and full integration test coverage for hunt/patrol. The roadmap focuses on enterprise scalability and plugin ecosystem.
